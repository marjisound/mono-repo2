  // "body": "<p>Nicolás Maduro has confirmed top Venezuelan officials have been talking to members of Donald Trump’s White House, after reports his second-in-command had been negotiating his downfall with the United States.</p> <p>“I confirm that for months there have been contacts between senior officials from Donald Trump’s government and from the Bolivarian government over which I preside – with my express and direct permission,” Venezuela’s authoritarian leader said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VTVcanal8/status/1163961687399182336?s=20\">a televised address</a> on Tuesday night.</p> <p>“Various contacts through various channels,” Maduro added.</p> <p>Maduro’s remarks came after two reports in the US media claimed Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela’s most powerful and feared men, had been engaged in <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/a3e6b0da8c5648558e61bbaa466fbb42\">“secret communications”</a> with Trump officials.</p> <p>On Sunday <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/scoop-inside-trumps-naval-blockade-obsession-555166b0-06f9-494c-b9fb-9577a589e2ac.html\">Axios claimed</a> that in recent months Cabello, the 56-year-old head of Venezuela’s pro-Maduro constituent assembly, had been communicating with Trump’s top Latin America adviser, Mauricio Claver-Carone. Some Trump officials reportedly considered that a positive sign suggesting Maduro’s circle was “gradually cracking”.</p> <p>The Associated Press claimed Cabello had met someone “in close contact with the Trump administration” in Caracas last month and that a second meeting was envisioned. The US reportedly hoped engaging with Cabello would intensify an internal “knife fight” supposedly raging at the pinnacle of Maduro’s administration.</p> <p>Observers of Venezuelan politics greeted those reports – apparently designed to destablise Maduro’s crisis-stricken administration by stoking paranoia within his inner-circle - with scepticism.</p> <p>Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House thinktank, said: “I think what the US is trying to do is some sort of psy ops thing<em>,</em> trying to rattle people within Maduro’s administration.”</p> <p>But on Tuesday Maduro confirmed contact with the US, which he painted as proof that he had been seeking ways “for president Donald Trump to truly listen to Venezuela and the truth of the 21st century Bolivarian revolution”.</p> <p>Earlier in the day Trump told reporters: “We’re talking to various representatives of Venezuela. I don’t want to say who, but we are talking at a very high level.”</p> <p>Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, described reports there had been talks between Cabello and Trump officials as “a very positive sign”.</p> <p>“It suggests an understanding at the top level of [Maduro’s] government that this is unsustainable,” he said of Venezuela’s ongoing economic, political and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6459434-b531-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b\">humanitarian meltdown</a>.</p> <p>“I think what these people are looking for is some kind of guarantee [from the US] that they are not going to end up in a jail cell in Miami,” Ramsey added.</p> <p>Maduro has been fighting for his political life since January when a young opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, declared himself Venezuela’s rightful president and received the backing of more than 50 governments, including the US and UK.</p> <p>More than four million Venezuelans have now fled their oil-rich but economically devastated nation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/venezuela-exodus-4-million-un-refugee-agency\">according to the UN’s refugee agency</a>, with at least 1 million people leaving since last November alone.</p>",

Her colleagues were similarly delighted. “I’m so proud to be a Michaela teacher today,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tkendalluk/status/1164471970949410816?s=20\">tweeted</a> the maths teacher Thomas Kendall. “It feels like winning the league. The kids deserve it so much for all their hard work.”</p> <p>Compared with other non-selective state schools, Michaela’s results rank among the best in the country. More than half (54%) of all grades were level 7 or above (equivalent to the old-style A and A*), which was more than twice the national average of 22%. Nearly one in five (18%) of all grades were 9s, compared with 4.5% nationally, and in maths, one in four results were level 9.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/dec/30/no-excuses-inside-britains-strictest-school\">'No excuses': inside Britain's strictest school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Birbalsingh’s Twitter feed documented her morning – the girl who got straight 9s, the boy who used to be badly behaved but did brilliantly, the disbelief of another pupil as he read, and reread, his results – “Miss, these can’t be real” – the staff celebration.</p> <p>In a subsequent interview with the Guardian, Birbalsingh could not disguise her delight. “It’s really great. When you think all of our kids are from the inner city, they are from challenging backgrounds, they are deprived kids. I don’t have any white, middle-class kids in the school.”</p> <p>Birbalsingh first attracted controversy when, as deputy head at a school in south London, she criticised school behaviour policies in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/26/katharine-birbalsingh-tory-teacher-interview\">high-profile speech</a> to the Conservative party conference in 2010. The speech alienated many in the teaching profession and she was left shaken and jobless.</p> <p>It has been a long haul since then. Another tweet described her journey:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Miss_Snuffy/status/1164223698871771137\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.

The school hit the headlines again when it was reported that children whose parents had failed to pay for their lunches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/29/headteacher-defends-policy-of-putting-pupils-in-lunch-isolation\">were made to eat separately</a> from their classmates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/22/closing-the-gcse-attainment-gap-cant-be-up-to-schools-alone\">Closing the GCSE attainment gap can’t be up to schools alone | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I think it’s hilarious to say we are the strictest school in Britain,” laughed Birbalsingh. “It’s a joyful and happy place. The children are so happy to be here.” Two years ago, the schools’ watchdog Ofsted vindicated her approach when it judged Michaela outstanding in all categories. A second school, following the same model, has been approved and will open in Stevenage in Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Birbalsingh puts Michaela’s success down to “conservative values – with a small c”. She lists them – belief in personal responsibility, respect for authority and a sense of duty towards others. “I’ve always known the school is great, because I’m here every day and the children are wonderful. What I’m most proud of is the young adults they’ve become. They are good people.”</p>",
  // "body": "<p>Get set for peak Peaky Blinders as the return of the cult gangster drama heralds a global expansion, from a dapper clothing range backed by David Beckham to books, video games and its own two-day festival.</p> \n<p>The eagerly awaited fifth series of the Birmingham-set show returns on Sunday, making its debut on BBC1, the country’s most-watched channel – a testament to its elevation to crown jewel status alongside the corporation’s biggest returning dramas such as Line of Duty.</p> \n<p>The exploits of the Shelby family – under their leader, Tommy, played by Cillian Murphy – have proven to be a global hit, with a Netflix deal making the show available in more than 180 countries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’ve had A-list celebrities and rock stars get in touch to say how much they love it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Creator Steven Knight</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“It began with an incredible response in the UK and now all over the world,” says Steven Knight, the Birmingham-born creator and writer of Peaky Blinders. “I talked to someone recently who had been in Panama City and a barman told him he was saving enough money to come to Birmingham to see the streets where Peaky Blinders happened. I’ve had A-list celebrities and rock stars get in touch to say how much they love it.”</p> \n<p>In fact, it was a knock on the door by one celebrity fan, David Beckham, that resulted in a partnership for an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/fashion/2019/jan/06/david-beckhams-menswear-label-doffs-cap-peaky-blinders-kent-curwen\">official range of Peaky Blinders-inspired clothing</a>. The line is from Kent &amp; Curwen, the fashion label co-owned by Beckham, and will debut in its chain of more than 160 stores globally from October as well as being made available online.</p> \n<p>“David is a big fan, so is his son, and they approached us and said they wanted to do a Peaky Blinders capsule range,” Knight says.</p> \n<p>He says that despite the growing popularity of the show, historically there had not been a focus on fostering the development of the brand beyond TV. “By the end of series four it became very obvious around the world there was a thing happening,” he says. “That is when we started looking at a full range of products.”</p> \n<p>The first official online store opened in June, offering “fan-based apparel” such as T-shirts and hoodies; in October, Superdrug will unveil a men’s grooming range and there will be an international launch of a Peaky Blinders book; and by Christmas there could even by a Peaky fragrance to go with the official 2020 calendar. Next year, virtual reality and console games will be launched, where players can “be a Peaky Blinder”, and talks about a smartphone version are in the works.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6be5eea5d34e046e42fe2d4e6fa36f16389df4de\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6be5eea5d34e046e42fe2d4e6fa36f16389df4de/790_304_3477_2086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen McCrory as Polly Gray in Peaky Blinders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen McCrory as Polly Gray in Peaky Blinders.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/Caryn Mandabach Productions Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The move to top billing on primetime BBC1 will give Peaky Blinders an extra boost among UK audiences of at least 50% beyond its old home on BBC2, providing the perfect marketing springboard to fuel the ambitious commercial expansion of the brand. </p> \n<p>A near-two-year wait for a new series has served to raise the excitement level among fans.

It sells them through a Peaky Blinders-trademarked website.</p> \n<p>In early 2014, during the run-up to series two, Sadler’s Ales, based in Stourbridge, launched a Peaky Blinder beer <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/sadlers-ales-launches-peaky-blinders-6907399\">citing the show as inspiration</a>. It uses images of the original gang and has since expanded to include gin, whisky and rum and a “fan pack” offering a flat cap and razor pin. In 2017, the company registered “Peaky Blinder” as its official trademark in the beer and spirits category.</p> \n<p>“[The TV show makers] couldn’t release a Peaky Blinder gin as that would encroach on our intellectual property,” says Chris Dew, the marketing manager at Sadler’s Brewery. “Initially, we were celebrated by the show; there were shots of the cast drinking the beer. But as time has gone on and the show has got bigger we have disassociated from each other to stay in our lanes.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Our trademark system is what is known as a first-to-file system</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lawyer Iain Connor</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Ironically, early last year when the show’s makers made an attempt to trademark the Peaky Blinders name in 10 categories of products, it was opposed by Chaos Brothers and Halewood International, <a href=\"https://halewood-int.com/our-business/breweries/sadlers-brewery/\">which owns Sadler’s Brewery</a> and also Windsor Castle Brewery, which has a “Peaky” beer. The issue remains mired at the European International Property Office.</p> \n<p>“Our trademark system is what is known as a first-to-file system,” says Iain Connor, a lawyer with Pinsent Masons. “If you get there first you have the rights. It seems obvious to register a trademark [beyond TV] but you don’t know if you have a hit show on your hands; everyone misses the boat as it is often last on the list.”</p> \n<p>Jane Smith, the group director of licensing and gaming at Endemol Shine, which handles the Peaky Blinders business, says that because the show is based on a true story it cannot nail down all the rights.</p> \n<p>“We work very hard on registering trademarks and in terms of infringements we are very active,” she says. “We know there were people ahead of us. We have had conversations about how to resolve issues and coexist. Never do they touch the TV series, that is our red line.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\" data-atom-id=\"a1d2d12c-ae47-4fc3-9ff1-8a9633f2f40c\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n <details

Her desperate family won't give up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This week the commission’s 1,200-page final report concluded that the murder and disappearance of Indigenous women and girls in Canada constituted a “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/world/2019/jun/03/canada-indigenous-genocide-women-report\">race-based genocide</a>” and laid out more than 200 policy recommendations for future action.</p> \n<p>But Smith and her team have no plans to end their work: tragedy continues to befall Indigenous families across the country. More than 130 Indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been killed <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-inquiry-new-cases-statistics-databases-1.5162482\">since the inquiry began</a> its work in 2016, according to a CBC News database.</p> \n<p>“Yes, the inquiry is important work. And yes, it’s important for families to have their voices heard,” said Smith. “But at the same time, it’s important to start addressing this now and to stop the violence from happening.”</p> \n<p>The commission’s report was officially released on Monday at an emotional ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, which brought together Indigenous leaders, families of murdered women and the survivors of abuse.</p> \n<p>Its pages chronicled generations of trauma against Indigenous peoples, including the disproportionate gender-based violence experienced by women and girls throughout the country.</p> \n<p>The gravity of discriminatory policies against Indigenous peoples meant that calling it “genocide” was an “inescapable conclusion”, said the chief commissioner, Marion Buller.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba52b3be73072c99261f823367cb9ef41ea45e27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba52b3be73072c99261f823367cb9ef41ea45e27/0_184_4390_2634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An attendee of the closing ceremony for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls holds a photo of a lost family member in Gatineau, Quebec, on 3 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An attendee of the closing ceremony for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls holds a photo of a lost family member in Gatineau, Quebec, on 3 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Wyld/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The report stressed that its recommendations were legally binding, but some of those on the front lines of the crisis – whose work spurred calls for an inquiry – are asking whether this time will be any different.</p> \n<p>Grassroots organizations across the country have long advocated for changes in policing, child welfare and education, but their calls have fallen on deaf ears.</p> \n<p>“There’s a long list of reports and recommendations that could help us and they just sit on the shelves. And that’s why I keep asking: ‘What are you doing to implement those recommendations?” said Lorelei Williams, a longtime advocate for missing and murdered women. Williams is still searching for her aunt, Belinda Williams who vanished in 1978; her cousin Tanya Holyk was murdered by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/world/2007/dec/10/uk.leeglendinning\">serial killer Robert Pickton</a> in 1996.</p> \n<p>“We have this attention now with the national inquiry, but how long is that going to last for?” she asked. “At the end of the day women are still going to go missing and are being murdered.”</p> \n<p>Smith’s work is also motived in part by personal loss. Her sister, Claudette Osborne, disappeared in 2008 and remains missing. The family had no resources to publicise her case and no institutional help.</p> \n<p>“The police said they needed evidence to search, and they didn’t have any – so they weren’t going to. It took them 10 days to actually start investigating my sister’s case.”</p> \n<p>The report sharply rebukes police services in Canada – especially the country’s federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).</p> \n<p>“The continued racism and sexism by many RCMP officers directed at Indigenous peoples, the high rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women … have caused many Indigenous peoples and communities to lose trust and confidence in the Canadian justice system, the RCMP and police services in general,” said the report.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/us-news/2019/jun/07/indigenous-women-missing-murdered-activists-ride-north-america\">'No more stolen sisters': 12,000-mile ride to highlight missing indigenous women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As a result of her poor experience with police, Smith and other activists took matters into their own hands. In 2014, when 15-year-old <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile.guardianapis.com/uk/items/us-news/2019/may/01/savanna-act-native-women-missing-murdered\">Tina Fontaine</a> went missing, Smith gathered a group to scour the river for the young woman.</p> \n<p>Since then, Drag the Red has grown from 25 committed volunteers to hundreds. The organization has received boats as donations and in five years of dragging the river, they say they have helped in the recovery three bodies – two men and one woman – as well as pulling up human teeth and hair. They also help families react to the news of a missing loved one, including how to hold a vigil and how to organize. </p> \n<p>“We want people to know that we are actively on that river. We are actively searching the banks of the Red River,” said Smith. “If you think you’re going to put a body in that river, that it’s not going to be found – think again.”</p> \n<p>While Smith and Williams are hopeful the inquiry will have a lasting impact, the daily work of activism that underpins the report weighs heavily.</p> \n<p>“I feel like I’ve taken an emotional beating. But at the end of the day, I’m trying to get my missing aunt’s picture out there. That’s what keeps me going. I want to honour my cousin,” said Williams. “But I also realize that the pain and the exhaustion I feel is nothing compared to what they, or the rest of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, have gone through.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was amended on 11 June 2019 because an earlier version overstated the number of bodies Drag the Red was said to have recovered. Members of the organization say they have helped in the recovery three bodies. This has been corrected. </p>",
